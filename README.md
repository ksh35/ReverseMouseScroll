**A tool that inverts only mouse scrolling**

Many people physically scroll down on a mouse to scroll down but physically scroll up on a trackpad to scroll down. Mac OS doesn't natively
support independent scrolling directions. This app provides a solution for this.

ReverseMouseScroll sets up event taps and inverts scrolling if the source of the scroll is non-continuous (mice). 

To use the app without issues, make sure the signing certificate is set to "Development" before building in xcode.
